# Gettext

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-lang/gettext.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/elixir-lang/gettext)

`gettext` is an internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) system commonly used for writing multilingual programs. Gettext is a standard for i18n in different communities, meaning there is a great set of tooling for developers and translators.

## Installation

## Usage

To use gettext, you must define a gettext module:

    defmodule MyApp.Gettext do
      use Gettext, otp_app: :my_app
    end

And invoke the gettext API, based on many `*gettext` functions:

    import MyApp.Gettext

    # Simple translation
    gettext "Here is the string to translate"

    # Plural translation
    ngettext "Here is the string to translate",
             "Here are the strings to translate",
             3

    # Domain-based translation
    dgettext "errors", "Here is the string to translate"

Translations in gettext are stored in Portable Object files (`.po`). The default domain should be placed at `priv/gettext/en/LC_MESSAGES/domain.po` with the following format:

    #: lib/foo/translation.ex:15
    msgid "Here is the string to translate"
    msgstr "Aqui est√° o texto para traduzir"

`.po` are text based and can be editted directly by translators. Some may even use existing tools for managing them, such as [Poedit](http://poedit.net/).

### Auto-synchronization

Because translations are based on strings, your source code does not lose readability as you still see literal strings, like `gettext "here is an example"`, instead of paths like `translate "some.path.convention"`. Furthermore, by adding `gettext "here is an example"`, your code continues to work as before, as `gettext` will return the given string if no translation is found.

Finally, due to the properties above, `gettext` is also able to synchronize `.po` files with your source code. For example, if you add the following to an Elixir file:

    gettext "Welcome back!"

Running `mix gettext.extract` will automatically sync all existing entries to `.pot` (template files). `.pot` files can then be merged into the `.po` files with `mix gettext.merge`.
